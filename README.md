# What StormShop is ...

StormShop is a project that sells scripts and subscriptions (mostly for Russian users).
You can buy it on our [website](https://nitro-storm.ru) / [telegram bot](https://t.me/storm_nitro_shop_bot) / [discord server](https://discord.gg/BNsV86yGQA) ... etc.

What about scripts? You can easily buy them on our [website](https://nitro-storm.ru). After purchasing you get the archive and README.md file with all instructions. If you wish, we can add you into private GitHub repository with the script you purchased!

# What StormShop made of ...

## Website: Frontend
For frontend we used React with Typescript. We also use ViteJS instead of Webpack as it's more convenient and fast!
P.S. We could try to move to NextJS sometime in the future. It's not a promise though.

## Backend
For backend... we had little argue about that because one of the developers used to be a C++ developer but we decided to use NodeJS for backend. It might be slow relatively C++ but it's definetely easier to make backend using NodeJS than C++.
P.S. May be in the future if the project grows fast, we might change our mind about NodeJS!

## Telegram Bot
What about telegram bot? - Python. Because the developer initially worked on the bot was a Python Developer.

That's it for now, let's move to Russian verios of README...
